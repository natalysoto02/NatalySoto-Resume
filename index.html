        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Nataly Soto and I am currently a first year college student. I attend the University of California, Riverside and I am currently undeclared. Although I am undeclared, I have become very intrested in Accounting.I would love to graduate with a BA in Business with a concentration in accounting and become a public certified accountant. I am still unsure if I would like to continue my education and recieve my MBA but I am staying postive and determined that i will get to do so. I am a very determined student who wants to achieve the most they can. I have recieved a gpa higher than 3.5 for 2 consecutive quarters. I had also graduated high school last year with high honors and multiple awards. While maintaining good grades I have also become somewhat invloved in my learning community. Attending multiple virtual events and attempting to socialize as much as I can.In high school I had been heavily involved in highshcool and really enjoyed it becasue thats how i met many of my friends. I hope to do the same in college and explore outside my comfrot zone.  <br><br>

        Besides being a full time student, I also do many things during my free time. I really enjoy running with friends and family. I haave ran a total of 2 marathons and currently training to run my 3rd. Training is extremely difficult physicaly and as well with time management. I still manage to have some extra time during my day to continue running those miles so I can be prepared. Although there are many obstacles attempting to hold me back from training, I stay determined and work around to find a soulution. Another think I enjoy doing during my free time is helping my community. During such rough times, it has been very difficult for many so I feel that as a community we should help as much as we can. I have participated in food drives to help collect food for those in need. In the past, I have also donated necessary items to give to individulas who had been impacted by any natural disaster. This had not only given me the opportunity to help other but has as well encouraged me to keep helping those I can. Lastly, I really enjoy spending time with family and friends.  <br><br>

        Three characterists about me are that I am very determined, optimistic, and fast on my feet. I would say I am very determined because I am someone who doesn't give up easily. I dont give up until I able to fully understand or get what I have desired. I find it imporatant for someoene to be patients and stay determined, especially when it comes with goals. Things will not always come easily so its up to you to keep working and not give up. I would also describe myself as optimitic because many would describe me s a very postive person. I love looking at things at a postive perspercitve and enjoying every opportunity Im given. Like my mother would always tell me "Things happen for a reason." and I always remind myself this. Living life in a postive perspective gives makes you a overall happier person. Lastly, I would describe myself as some works fast on thier feet. I dont say this only becasue im a runner but also because I am a pretty fast thinker. Throughout all my years of procastinating, i have become a student who can work well under pressure. I am able to come up with ideas and soultions faster. Although procastinating may seem as a red flag and it can be but what i have taken away from it are very valuable skills.
